<h3 style="left:220px; position:relative"> Cyber Drag - Performance for the Camera and the Screen </h3>
<p style="left:240px; position: relative; width:700px;">

"Give a man a mask and he will tell you the truth" - Oscar Wilde <br/> <br/>

"The body continued forever, shifting. In every moment it seemed different, 
fitting to what the eyes knew was there. Mouse did not know whether he was there or was there just a machine-image he made. 
He did not care." Samuel R. Delany <br/> <br/>

Description: <br/>

Oscar Wilde noted that "Man is least himself when he talks in his own person. 
Give him a mask, and he will tell you the truth". Shakespeare is oft quoted to say "All the world's a stage/ 
And all the men and women are merely players". 
Online, under the cover of anonymity and self editing, 
this performance becomes both more apparent and more subtle in its effects. 
The class will research how the making of the online persona and performing to camera can affect the world.
 We will explore the ideas of accepting the produced online image not only as an outcome, 
 but also as a starting point for a view on reality. We will cover a range of approaches from pop persona 
 (e.g. Janelle Monáe and Drexciya), through artist (e.g. Rebecca Horn and Ryan Trecartin) to author 
 (e.g. Samuel R. Delany and J.G. Ballard). In this class students will research the relations between 
 technology and identity through web art, 3D printing, sewing, wearable circuitry, video, photography and other modes of production.

<h3 style="left:220px; position:relative"> <br/>WIRED 1: Digital Imaging and Web Presence</h3>
<p style="left:220px; position:relative; width:700px">
About WIRED: <br/>

This 1.5 credit hour course is intended to enhance the first year program curriculum by providing 
structured, targeted tutorials that introduce students to basic and advanced imaging and web 
authoring techniques in an academic context that is both critical and celebratory of the new media 
tools - both proprietary and open-source - to facilitate art production. The tutorials are also designed 
to assist first year core faculty in encouraging students to document and share their research and 
studio projects online with their peers. The web is a medium that now must be understood and 
managed by artists from any field; for this reason, the curriculum is focused on imaging for the web, 
and authoring (HTML) for the web. The course also provides a survey of new online collaborative 
research tools.

	Dear Jes<br/><br/>
	
	I am writing to express my great interest in the position of Instructor at the Early College Program
	As my attached CV demonstrates, I have experience teaching at the college level in both traditional and new media. 
	My own artistic practice incorporates video, net-art, archival arts, creative coding and 3D printing.  
	<br/><br/>
	
	 As an artist I wish to research the relationship between the body and its inanimate environment. 
	 This interest led me to an MFA at SAICâ€™s Department of Art and Technology Studies. During the 
	 program I was exposed to 3D printing as well as creative coding. I have, as can be seen in my 
	 work, developed an interest in impossible conversations that question the ability to comprehend the 
	 world. For example, I facilitated a series of private conversation with the stars that were 
	 broadcasted to outer space with a hacked ham radio. 
	 <br/><br/>
	 My practice is all over the map, both literally and figuratively. I am interested in the body 
	but also outer space, and I am as likely to strike up a conversation about rewardless orchids 
	as I am to start a debate about the meaning of life with a sweet potato. As a recent transplant 
	to Chicago, my practice has shifted to include an intense interest in loneliness and long distance 
	relationships. The role of technology, and especially the internet, is naturally an integral 
	part of this preoccupation. 
	 <br/><br/>

	During the last semester I developed and taught four sections of a course on digital imaging 
	and web-art at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. This was a class in the 
	first year of the Bachelor degree program aimed at the introduction of new types of media as 
	well as the cultural and personal significance of the Internet. Students were familiarized with
	 the idea of internet citizenship and were shown how they can be active creators of content and 
	 identity rather than passive consumers. During the previous year I assisted students in a number 
	 of classes that included art history seminars and project-based courses. One of these was a course
	  titled Prehistory of New Media that explored New Media and code art prior to the title's origin 
	  in the 1980's. I also assisted a graduate level seminar on experimental approaches to writing 
	  in a collaborational setting.   
	<br/><br/>
	
	I am applying since I consider teaching an intrinsic part of my artistic practice. My interest lies in new ways to look 
	at the world and I found out that teaching is an amazing way to be exposed to new ways and find new outlooks.
	<br/><br/> 
	Thank you in advance for your consideration.<br/>
	Best regards,<br/>
	Guy Eytan
